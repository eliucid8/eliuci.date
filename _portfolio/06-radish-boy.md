### July 2023

*The Adventures of Radish Boy* was a puzzle-platformer game some friends and I developed in less than 48 hours for the [2023 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023).
This was my first time working on such a project both collaboratively and under such a short timeframe. I learned a lot during these 48 hours about game development, effective collaboration, music composition, Unity Engine's build system, and much, much, more.
It was an absolute blast working with [Joe Arch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-arch/), [Aidan Klein](https://aidanpklein.com/), [Jacob Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-lee-973a76198/), [John Schappert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-schappert/), [Eleanor Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleanorptaylor/), and [Randy Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-xu-b9257423a/)!

I would say my biggest contribution to the original jam submission was dealing with the peculiarities of the build system. Near the end of the jam, as we were looking to submit the project, we found ourselves unable to build the project for WebGL. 
Since we had used git to collaborate on this project, I was able to roll back to a successfully building version of the project and merge our recent changes into a recovery branch, allowing us to get our submission in on time.

We ended up placing 33rd out of nearly 17,000 entries, a result we were incredibly proud of. We even made it in to GMTK's jam results video!

After the jam ended, our team got together to add some more content and polish, including a title sequence and a final boss. You can check out our final version of the game below (fullscreen recommended), or on [itch.io](https://jrschappert.itch.io/the-adventures-of-radish-boy-2). Have fun!
