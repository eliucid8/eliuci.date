In this project, I: 
* Implemented a 2D graphics engine, complete with Polygons, Shaders, Bezier Curves, Affine Transforms, and Meshes, in C++.
* Designed and implemented algorithms with a focus on performance, utilizing techniques such as forward difference, templating, and
cache-friendliness.
* Used developer tools for testing and profiling, such as GDB, Valgrind, and KCacheGrind.
