I originally created this chess set for use on a backpacking trip.
I've since refined the design for easier assembly and clearer pieces.

The pieces have magnets integrated into their base, ensuring they snap in to place during gameplay.
They're designed to be easily printable and recognizable by a few methods despite their small size.

I parameterized all of the dimensions of my pieces in order to enable quicker iteration for fitting the set into a single tin.

{% include gallery caption="This chess set is small and light enough to fit in a pocket, and can be played anywhere due to the magnetized pieces." %}
