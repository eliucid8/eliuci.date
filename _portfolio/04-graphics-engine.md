### January 2024 - May 2024

In this project, I: 
* Implemented a 2D graphics engine, complete with Polygons, Shaders, Bezier Curves, Affine Transforms, and Meshes, in C++.
* Designed and implemented algorithms with a focus on performance, utilizing techniques such as forward difference, templating, and
cache-friendliness.
* Used developer tools for testing and profiling, such as GDB, Valgrind, and KCacheGrind.

This project, completed as a part of Compsci 345 - Computer Graphics Architecture, is the result of a semester's worth of development. 
We were asked to maintain this project by adding more features to our engines each week whilst maintaining robust project structure.
Throughout this project I learned much about the foundations of computer graphics and code optimization.

Here are a few demonstrations of the capabilities of this project.
