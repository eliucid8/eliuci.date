# Hello!
Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally have a space to put out my thoughts without a character limit (or any other expectations of concision).

You can expect more to be put up here as I go through my journey of prematurely optimizing my life: switching to neovim, using Obsidian as a planner, any projects I find the time or attention for (although I'm sure those will be hard to miss), and anything else I end up thinking is good enough to publish to the blogosphere. (Has anyone other than XKCD ever used that term?)

Anyways, more to come soon! For now, I'll leave you with this [offering][my-offering].
